  <h1>Irish Car Bomb</h1>
  <p>Preparation: The whiskey is floated on top of the Irish cream in a shot glass, and the shot glass is then dropped into the stout.
  </p>
  <p>Ingredients</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pint Irish stout</li>
    <li>1/2 oz. Irish cream</li>
    <li>1/4 oz. Coffee liqueur</li>
	<li>1/4 oz. Irish whiskey</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fun Fact: The name is considered offensive by many Irish people, with some bartenders refusing to serve it. The inclusion of the drink in an English bar's 2014 promotional material drew complaints, followed by withdrawal of the promotion and a public apology by the bar manager. Increasingly, bartenders prefer the title "Irish Slammer", "Irish Bomb Shot", "Car Crash," or simply the "Irish Bomb" to avoid offending patrons.
